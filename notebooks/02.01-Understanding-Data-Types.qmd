# Understanding Data Types in Python

Effective data-driven science and computation requires understanding how data is stored and manipulated.
This chapter outlines and contrasts how arrays of data are handled in the Python language itself, and how NumPy improves on this.
Understanding this difference is fundamental to understanding much of the material throughout the rest of the book.

Users of Python are often drawn in by its ease of use, one piece of which is
dynamic typing. While a statically typed language like C or Java requires each
variable to be explicitly declared, a dynamically typed language like Python
skips this specification. For example, in C you might specify a particular
operation as follows:

```C
/* C code */
int result = 0;
for(int i=0; i<100; i++){
    result += i;
}
```

While in Python the equivalent operation could be written this way:

```python
# Python code
result = 0
for i in range(100):
    result += i
```

Notice one main difference: in C, the data types of each variable are explicitly
declared, while in Python the types are dynamically inferred. This means, for
example, that we can assign any kind of data to any variable:

```python
# Python code
x = 4
x = "four"
```

Here we've switched the contents of `x` from an integer to a string. The same
thing in C would lead (depending on compiler settings) to a compilation error or
other unintended consequences:

```C
/* C code */
int x = 4;
x = "four";  // FAILS
```

This sort of flexibility is one element that makes Python and other dynamically
typed languages convenient and easy to use. Understanding *how* this works is an
important piece of learning to analyze data efficiently and effectively with
Python. But what this type flexibility also points to is the fact that Python
variables are more than just their values; they also contain extra information
about the *type* of the value. We'll explore this more in the sections that
follow.

## A Python Integer Is More Than Just an Integer

The standard Python implementation is written in C. This means that every Python
object is simply a cleverly disguised C structure, which contains not only its
value, but other information as well. For example, when we define an integer in
Python, such as `x = 10000`, `x` is not just a "raw" integer. It's actually a
pointer to a compound C structure, which contains several values. Looking
through the Python 3.10 source code, we find that the integer (long) type
definition effectively looks like this (once the C macros are expanded):

```C
struct _longobject {
    long ob_refcnt;
    PyTypeObject *ob_type;
    size_t ob_size;
    long ob_digit[1];
};
```

A single integer in Python 3.10 actually contains four pieces:

- `ob_refcnt`, a reference count that helps Python silently handle memory allocation and deallocation
- `ob_type`, which encodes the type of the variable
- `ob_size`, which specifies the size of the following data members
- `ob_digit`, which contains the actual integer value that we expect the Python variable to represent

This means that there is some overhead involved in storing an integer in Python
as compared to a compiled language like C, as illustrated in the following
figure:

![Integer Memory Layout](~/Pictures/figures//cint_vs_pyint.png)

Here, `PyObject_HEAD` is the part of the structure containing the reference
count, type code, and other pieces mentioned before.

Notice the difference here: a C integer is essentially a label for a position in
memory whose bytes encode an integer value. A Python integer is a pointer to a
position in memory containing all the Python object information, including the
bytes that contain the integer value. This extra information in the Python
integer structure is what allows Python to be coded so freely and dynamically.
All this additional information in Python types comes at a cost, however, which
becomes especially apparent in structures that combine many of these objects.

## A Python List Is More Than Just a List

Let's consider now what happens when we use a Python data structure that holds
many Python objects. The standard mutable multielement container in Python is
the list. We can create a list of integers as follows:


```python
L = list(range(10))
type(L[0])

```
Or, similarly, a list of strings:

```python
L2 = [str(c) for c in L]
L2
type(L2[0])

```

Because of Python's dynamic typing, we can even create heterogeneous lists:


```python
L3 = [True, "2", 3.0, 4]
[type(item) for item in L3]

```

But this flexibility comes at a cost: to allow these flexible types, each item
in the list must contain its own type, reference count, and other information.
That is, each item is a complete Python object. In the special case that all
variables are of the same type, much of this information is redundant, so it can
be much more efficient to store the data in a fixed-type array. The difference
between a dynamic-type list and a fixed-type (NumPy-style) array is illustrated
in the following figure:

![Array Memory Layout](~/Pictures/figures//array_vs_list.png)

At the implementation level, the array essentially contains a single pointer to
one contiguous block of data. The Python list, on the other hand, contains a
pointer to a block of pointers, each of which in turn points to a full Python
object like the Python integer we saw earlier. Again, the advantage of the list
is flexibility: because each list element is a full structure containing both
data and type information, the list can be filled with data of any desired type.
Fixed-type NumPy-style arrays lack this flexibility, but are much more efficient
for storing and manipulating data.

## Fixed-Type Arrays in Python

Python offers several different options for storing data in efficient,
fixed-type data buffers. The built-in `array` module (available since Python
3.3) can be used to create dense arrays of a uniform type:


```python
import array
L = list(range(10))
A = array.array('i', L)
A
```

Here, `'i'` is a type code indicating the contents are integers.

Much more useful, however, is the `ndarray` object of the NumPy package. While
Python's `array` object provides efficient storage of array-based data, NumPy
adds to this efficient *operations* on that data. We will explore these
operations in later chapters; next, I'll show you a few different ways of
creating a NumPy array.

## Creating Arrays from Python Lists

We'll start with the standard NumPy import, under the alias `np`:

```python
import numpy as np
```

Now we can use `np.array` to create arrays from Python lists:

```python
# Integer array
np.array([1, 4, 2, 5, 3])
```

Remember that unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays can only contain data of the same type.
If the types do not match, NumPy will upcast them according to its type promotion rules; here, integers are upcast to floating point:


```python
np.array([3.14, 4, 2, 3])
```

If we want to explicitly set the data type of the resulting array, we can use the `dtype` keyword:

```python
np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=np.float32)
```

Finally, unlike Python lists, which are always one-dimensional sequences, NumPy arrays can be multidimensional. Here's one way of initializing a multidimensional array using a list of lists:


```python
# Nested lists result in multidimensional arrays
np.array([range(i, i + 3) for i in [2, 4, 6]])
```

The inner lists are treated as rows of the resulting two-dimensional array.

## Creating Arrays from Scratch

Especially for larger arrays, it is more efficient to create arrays from scratch using routines built into NumPy.
Here are several examples:


```python
# Create a length-10 integer array filled with 0s
np.zeros(10, dtype=int)

# Create a 3x5 floating-point array filled with 1s
np.ones((3, 5), dtype=float)
# Create a 3x5 array filled with 3.14
np.full((3, 5), 3.14)


# Create an array filled with a linear sequence
# starting at 0, ending at 20, stepping by 2
# (this is similar to the built-in range function)
np.arange(0, 20, 2)
# Create an array of five values evenly spaced between 0 and 1
np.linspace(0, 1, 5)
# Create a 3x3 array of uniformly distributed
# pseudorandom values between 0 and 1
np.random.random((3, 3))
# Create a 3x3 array of normally distributed pseudorandom
# values with mean 0 and standard deviation 1
np.random.normal(0, 1, (3, 3))
# Create a 3x3 array of pseudorandom integers in the interval [0, 10)
np.random.randint(0, 10, (3, 3))
# Create a 3x3 identity matrix
np.eye(3)
# Create an uninitialized array of three integers; the values will be
# whatever happens to already exist at that memory location
np.empty(3)
```

## NumPy Standard Data Types

NumPy arrays contain values of a single type, so it is important to have
detailed knowledge of those types and their limitations. Because NumPy is built
in C, the types will be familiar to users of C, Fortran, and other related
languages.

The standard NumPy data types are listed in the following table. Note that when
constructing an array, they can be specified using a string:

```python
np.zeros(10, dtype='int16')
```

Or using the associated NumPy object:

```python
np.zeros(10, dtype=np.int16)
```

| `complex64` | Complex number, represented by two 32-bit floats| 
| `complex128`| Complex number, represented by two 64-bit floats| 

More advanced type specification is possible, such as specifying big- or
little-endian numbers; for more information, refer to the [NumPy
documentation](http://numpy.org/). NumPy also supports compound data types,
which will be covered in [Structured Data: NumPy's Structured
Arrays](02.09-Structured-Data-NumPy.ipynb).
